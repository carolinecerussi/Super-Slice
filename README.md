## Description

On the opened html browser, you will see a description and photo of the pizza resturant, and a button that is shaped like a pizza that when clicked, will bring you to the build your pizza page. You can then click on either a small medium or large pizza and select a series of toppings to add. When submitting those two forms, the order total will appear. The order total is formed by adding the additional values of each topping and size pizza, and will reflect on the page. You then can call the restaurant and place the order.
